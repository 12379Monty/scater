# scater: single-cell analysis tools for expression with R

This package contains useful tools for the analysis of single-cell
gene expression data using the statistical software R. The package places an
emphasis on tools for quality control, visualisation and pre-processing of data
before further downstream analysis.

The best place to start is the [vignette](github.com/davismcc/scater/blob/master/vignettes/vignette.Rmd).

The package leans heavily on previously published work and packages, namely [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) and [limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). It also uses and extends code for an approximate rank-product test by [Heskes et al (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0367-1).

The package is currently in an Alpha state, so may not be stable and is to
be used with caution. If you do use it, though, please contact me with
questions and suggestions to improve the package.
