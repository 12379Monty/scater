# scater: single-cell analysis tools for expression with R

This package contains useful tools for the analysis of single-cell
gene expression data using the statistical software R.

The package leans heavily on previously published work and packages, namely [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) and [limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). It also uses and extends code for an approximate rank-product test by [Heskes et al (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0367-1).

The package is currently in a pre-Alpha state, so is unstable and to
be used with caution. If you do use it, though, please contact me with
questions and suggestions to improve the package.
