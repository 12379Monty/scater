# scater: single-cell analysis tools for expression with R

This package contains useful tools for the analysis of single-cell
gene-expression data using the statistical software R.

The package leans heaviliy on previously published work and packages, namely [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) and [limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). It also uses and extends code for an exact rank-product test by [Eisgina et al (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.01.037).

I hope you find the package useful. Please contact me with questions and suggestions to improve the package.
