We'd rather not do quality control. We'd all rather spend our time answering exciting scientific questions and fitting sexy statistical models to nice clean datasets. Sadly, getting those nice clean datasets takes a lot of work. Work vital for the success of projects in genomics, but boring work. This package, `scater` aims to ease this burden, making rigorous QC easier so that we can get to the exciting stuff quicker.\r\n\r\nThis package contains useful tools for the analysis of single-cell gene expression data using the statistical software R. The package places an emphasis on tools for quality control, visualisation and pre-processing of data before further downstream analysis.\r\n\r\nBy providing wrapper functions to [`kallisto`](http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/), a tool for extremely fast quantification of transcript abundance from RNA-seq reads, we can go from a set of FASTQ files to an object in an R session with summarised abundance values in a couple of lines of code, in a remarkably short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe `scater` package provides a sane data structure for single-cell RNA-seq data based on [Bioconductor's](http://www.bioconductor.org/) [*ExpressionSet*](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html), to organise complicated datasets with convenient subsetting. \r\n\r\nWe provide many plotting functions and functions to compute QC metrics and make it easy to work through pre-processing, QC and normalisation steps. \r\n\r\nWe hope that `scater` fills a useful niche between raw RNA-sequencing data and more focused downstream modelling tools such as \r\n[monocle](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/monocle.html), [scLVM](http://github.com/PMBio/scLVM),\r\n[SCDE](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/scde/index.html), [edgeR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html), [limma](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) and \r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThis package currently lives on GitHub, so I recommend using Hadley Wickham's \r\n`devtools` package to install `scater` directly from GitHub. If you don't have \r\n`devtools` installed, then install that from CRAN (as shown below) and then run\r\nthe call to install `scater`:\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"davismcc/scater\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe plan to contribute `scater` to [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe best place to start is the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/davismcc/scater/blob/master/inst/doc/vignette.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements and disclaimer\r\n\r\nThe package leans heavily on previously published work and packages, namely \r\n[edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) and \r\n[limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). The `SCESet` is heavily inspired by the `CellDataSet` class from [monocle](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/monocle.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nIt also uses and extends code for an approximate rank-product test by [Heskes et al (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0367-1).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThe package is currently in an Alpha state, so is to be used with appropriate \r\ncaution. Please do try it, though, and contact me with bug reports, feedback, \r\nquestions and suggestions to improve the package.\r\n\r\nDavis McCarthy, May 2015","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
